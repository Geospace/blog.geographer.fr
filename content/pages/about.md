## About emojis

Emojis render very differently depending on the plateform. Moreover, a lot of
my visitors use Linux and may not even be able to display emojis correctly.

This is why I use Twitter's [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) to ensure
consistent and uniform emoji rendering across all browsers and operating
systems.
