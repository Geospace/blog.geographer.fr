## About this blog

This blog is statically generated using a [custom Python project](https://github.com/Geospace/geoblog).
It does not have a lot of features right now but I wanted to have my own
codebase and incrementally add more features and optimizations.

I also like the idea that anyone can contribute to this blog simply by
making a pull request.

## About emojis

Emojis render very differently depending on the plateform. Moreover, a lot of
my visitors use Linux and may not even be able to display emojis correctly.

This is why I use Twitter's [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) to ensure
consistent and uniform emoji rendering across all browsers and operating
systems.

## About my avatar

It is [Senbei Norimaki](https://drslump.fandom.com/wiki/Senbe_Norimaki), one
of the main characters of the *[Dr. Slump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Slump)* serie.

I am not an anime person but I enjoyed reading this one when I was a kid and I
think that Senbei has a lot of swag.
