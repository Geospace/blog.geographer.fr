The FIC (*Forum International de la Cybersécurité*) is an event that takes
place in Lille, France every year. This year, the French CTF team [Hexpresso](https://www.hexpresso.fr/)
organizes the CTF. These guys have a pretty strong high fun/low guessing
policy so I thought I will compete with my friends from Team Ropkek.

Turned out we did pretty well as we were the first team to finish the
qualification round and secure a slot for the finals.

Well, technically, XeR was first but he won't compete the finals and I want
to flex.

If you are interested in step 7 (a Use After Free, definitely the hardest
challenge of this qualification round), please take a look at
[this blogpost](https://github.com/Pycatchown/writeUps/blob/master/FIC/step7/wu_step7.md)
written by my teammate Shiro.

I'm excited for the finals. The other teams look very musclées so I'm scared
but its ok.
