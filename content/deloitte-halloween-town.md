*Halloween Town* ðŸŽƒ was a task labelled cryptography and worth 135 points.
It was actually mostly steganography/guessing. The task remained unsolved for
the most part of the competition, until the staff decided to release hints.

Let's begin with an nmap scan:

```
$ nmap 18.130.113.180
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-11-06 16:05 GMT

```

So we have access to this front:

There really is nothing here... Then I downloaded the background image and
found out that the timestamp is weird:

```
root@3853909ffedf:/macOS/halloween# exiftool background.jpg
[...]
Modify Date                     : 1993:10:31 08:02:04
Y Cb Cr Positioning             : Centered
Exif Version                    : 0231
Date/Time Original              : 1993:10:31 08:02:04
Create Date                     : 1993:10:31 08:02:04
[...]
root@3853909ffedf:/macOS/halloween#
```

I got stuck here and stoped working on this challenge. A few hours later, the
staff recommended to use
[StegCracker](https://github.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker). This is mostly a
wrapper around `steghide`, with the ability to perform dictionnary attacks.

Let's try with `rockyou.txt`:

```

root@3853909ffedf:/macOS/halloween#
```

*Note: `steghide` really is a pain to install on macOS because of its
dependencies. An Ubuntu docker is a nice alternative.*

We now have a string. It looks like it's hexadecimal but the output is not
readable. I suspected that the string was xored but `xortool` could not find
anything so I got stuck again.

A few minutes before the end of the CTF, the staff released another
hint: the timestamp of the image is the key. One of my teammates had the idea
to convert the date into a UNIX timestamp. Because of the AM/PM thing, there
are two possible keys: `752097724` and `752054524`. The second is the right one.

We convert it to hexadecimal and xor it with the text we extracted using
`steghide`. The output decodes as:

```
535646564e014502045c4c6d055600474b6b025e015c0603055c014a ^ 373532303534353234

dctf{5p00ky_5c4ry_5k3l370n5}5
```

Final flag: `dctf{5p00ky_5c4ry_5k3l370n5}`.
