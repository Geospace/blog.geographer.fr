I am currently studying at Kent University in the UK so I had the chance to
participate in the Deloitte CTF Quals. It is a jeopardy CTF for all the
universities in the UK. The top 6 teams (with a maximum of one team per
university) are then qualified for the finals that take place in London.

Here are my writeups:

* [Superhero 🦸](/posts/superhero)
* [Why oh why I try again… sea shells she sails, nooo! 🏖️](/posts/deloitte-sea-shells-she-sails)
* [Query query on the wall.. Who’s the fairest of them all? 👸🏻](/posts/deloitte-query-query)
* [PatchMe 🤕](/posts/deloitte-patchme)
* [Halloween Town 🎃](/posts/deloitte-halloween-town)
* [g0dmode’s Pizza Shop 🍕](/posts/deloitte-godmod-pizza)

I played with a bunch of friends also from EPITECH (my school in France)
and we managed to end up at the second place. Really looking forward for
the final round, we want that 3.000£.

A big thanks to Deloitte for this event, awesome experience. And thanks also
to the staff members who kindly put some challenges back online after the
end of the CTF so that I could write these writeups.
